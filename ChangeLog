	* src/Language/Haskell/Refact/Utils/TypeUtils.hs
	(adjustLayoutAfterRename): Adjust layout in a do expression after renaming
	(adjustLayoutAfterRename): Adjust layout in a where expression
	after renaming

	* Re-align tokens when renaming the condition of a case statement
	to have a different length
	* When refactoring a CPP pre-processed file, read the preprocessor
	directives and non-compiled code as comments, so the source can be
	round-tripped. This allows refactoring of simple #if/#else/#endif
	code. NOTE: no refactoring is done on code that is not live after
	the preprocessor.
2013-09-12  v0.7.0.5
	* Now able to get tokens for a file pre-processed with CPP. But it
	is the pre-processed output, so the CPP directives are stripped
	out when writing out the refactored source.
